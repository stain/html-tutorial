_Reviving a HTML tutorial from 2000_

This HTML tutorial was originally published in Norwegian in 2000 at <http://www.nvg.org/nvg/kurs/html/> [[archived 2000-09-02]](http://web.archive.org/web/20000902120405/http://www.nvg.org/nvg/kurs/html/).

The intention of this GitHub repository <https://github.com/stain/html-tutorial/> is updating the course for HTML5 in 2019, clarifying licenses etc.

It may eventually provide translation to English.
